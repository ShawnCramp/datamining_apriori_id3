Date: October, 28th, 2016
-------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment Task:
The objective of this project is to implement two Data Mining
algorithms and test your implementations with various reasonably
large datasets. The term reasonably large is to be interpreted
as anywhere from a few hundreds to a few thousands instances (tuples).

You need to implement two Data Mining algorithms seen in class:
1. the ID3 algorithm, based on entropy/information gain, to build decision trees;
2. the Apriori algorithm for mining association rules;

All functions below are used for execution of the program and
are no involved in the logical process.
The Main function will be called upon code execution and the
user will be presented with a list of options on how to
proceed and view the code output he/she would like to view.
